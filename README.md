# ThatWasEasyButton
React website that mimics the That Was Easy button of old.
The goal of this website is to add an audio file to a button and when pressed it plays it. 
Exactly like the That Was Easy button that staples sells.

Goals:
1. Have an add button, button...
2. Create a modal that defines various fields in order to create said button. A name, the file, and maybe the color of the button.
3. I am going to follow the layout that I have in the design docs for the most part.
4. Have created buttons stored in local storage for later use.
5. Add edit/delete button modals for each corresponding button.
6. Have the title of the button to placed inside of the white space provided on the button image.
7. Audio file is played when the button is pressed.
